# UN voting coincidence

## Description

> Voting coincidence provides the “comparison of the overall voting practices in the principle bodies of the United Nations" requested by the Congress. Because the United Nations acts on so many diverse issues, the voting record of a UN member state during the General Assembly (193 members) and Security Council (5 permanent and 10 rotating members) provides insight into a country’s orientation in world arenas: where it stands, with whom it stands (at least in a UN context), and for what purpose. Voting coincidence data in this report refers only to the UN context and does not take into account support for U.S. policy positions in other multilateral fora or bilateral contexts. The vast majority of resolutions in various UN bodies are approved by consensus, in which no recorded vote is taken. Overall voting correlation between countries is highly dependent on the types of resolutions that come to a vote. For example, in the UNGA, Israel-related issues account for approximately one-quarter of resolutions that are adopted with a vote, skewing the voting coincidence metrics for countries that oppose these resolutions.
